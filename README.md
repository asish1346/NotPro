## Why are we better than the rest of the public scripts?

### ‚ú® Capybara Intro (game changer, killer feature)

![Capybara Intro](https://github.com/Dellenoam/NotPixelBot/blob/master/assets/Capybara_Intro.gif)

### üîç Proof-of-Humanity checks

We use **real** task solutions for proof-of-humanity checks instead of random responses, so you don't get banned.

There is still a chance of being banned, but it we did everything possible to prevent it.

### üé® Auto-Painting

We don't use random coordinates to paint on the canvas.

Our script automatically paints on the canvas using a template using data received from the websocket connection. It means that you will receive a PX for each painting you make!

### üåü Simple scripts to install NotPixelBot and uninstall it

We provide simple scripts for easy installation and uninstallation of the NotPixelBot.

### üîó We have a clear use of ref system

If you change the ref id to your own in the settings, that's what it will be. Our script does not prevent you from doing this, unlike some public scripts.

### üöÄ Regular updates

We update NotPixelBot according to changes in NotPixel.

## How to install üìö

Before you begin, make sure you have meet the [requirements](#requirements). It's really IMPORTANT, without these requiremenets, you can NOT install our script.

### Obtaining API Keys

1. Go to my.telegram.org and log in using your phone number.
2. Select "API development tools" and fill out the form to register a new application.
3. Record the API_ID and API_HASH provided after registering your application in the .env file.

Sometimes when creating a new application, it may display an error. It is still not clear what causes this, but you can try the solutions described on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68965496/my-telegram-org-sends-an-error-when-i-want-to-create-an-api-id-hash-in-api-devel).

### Linux manual installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/asish1346/NotPro.git
cd NotPro
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install poetry
poetry install --only main
cp .env-example .env
nano .env  # Specify your API_ID and API_HASH, the rest is taken by default
```

### Windows manual installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/asish1346/NotPro.git
cd NotPixelBot
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install poetry
poetry install --only main
copy .env-example .env
# Then open .env in any text editor and specify your API_ID and API_HASH, the rest is taken by default
```

### Windows installation using powershell script

NOTE: The install.ps1 script installs Chocolatey, a package manager for Windows, and uses it to install Python, Git, and NodeJS, if they are not already installed

We have also created powershell script which allows you to easily install NotPixelBot on Windows.

Before running the script, you must do some preparation

Open powershell and enter there this command. This will allow you to run scripts without restrictions.

```shell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

Ok, now we are ready. Execute following commands:

```shell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dellenoam/NotPixelBot/refs/heads/master/windows_scripts/install.ps1" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\install.ps1"

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:TEMP\install.ps1"
```

After that script will be downloaded to the temp folder and executed. When it asks you to enter path where to do git clone, just enter the path where you want to do git clone. For example `C:\Users\username\Scripts\NotPixelBot` without any quotes.

Navigate to the folder with the installed bot. Copy the .env-example file and rename it to .env, then open it in any editor and write down the API_ID and API_HASH that you received earlier.

Now you can proceed to the [Run the script](#run-the-script) section.

### Windows uninstallation using powershell script

NOTE: The install.ps1 script installs Chocolatey, which is then used to install Python, Git, and Node.js. This uninstall.ps1 script will also uninstall these programs using Chocolatey, including Chocolatey itself. However, it will not remove the NotPixelBot folder. Therefore, please be cautious.

If you want to uninstall NotPixelBot, run following commands:

```shell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dellenoam/NotPixelBot/refs/heads/master/windows_scripts/uninstall.ps1" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\uninstall.ps1"

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:TEMP\uninstall.ps1"
```

### Run the script

![NotPixel Intro](https://github.com/Dellenoam/NotPixelBot/blob/master/assets/NotPixel_Intro.gif)


#### Using start.bat

You can run the script using start.bat script, just execute it.

#### Manually

Before running the script, you ALWAYS need to activate the virtual environment and check for updates.

```shell
# Linux
source .venv\bin\activate
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Windows
git pull
```

To run the script, use `python3 main.py` on Linux or `python main.py` on Windows.

Also, you can use flag `--action` or `-a` to quickly run the script with specified action.

```shell
# Linux
python3 main.py --action [1/2]
# Windows
python main.py --action [1/2]

# Or

# Linux
python3 main.py -a [1/2]
# Windows
python main.py -a [1/2]
```

Where [1/2] is:

    1 - Creates a session
    2 - Run bot

So for example if you want to create a session, you can run this command:

```shell
# Linux
python3 main.py --action 1
# Windows
python main.py --action 1

# Or

# Linux
python3 main.py -a 1
# Windows
python main.py -a 1
```
